This simple Typescript project highlights the use of classes, interfaces, custom types, 
decorators and inheritance by creating an UI allowing the user to create projects, and
drag & drop to appropriate project status window.

To run:
1) In the terminal, run the command: nmp install --> installs all dependencies
2) In the same terminal, run the command: npm run start --> starts local server to display the project
3) In a new terminal, run the command: tsc -w --> allows for continues development with auto compilation
